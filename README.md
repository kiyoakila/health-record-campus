# Web application serving the management of people entering and leaving the neighborhood
This web app is built especially for the pandemic.

This application provides services to three groups of people: residents, gatekeepers and community managers.
1. Is a portal for residents to record health status and request to go out
2. Helps gatekeepers record the flow of people in and out the neighborhood
3. Helps community managers manage and add and change resident information, review resident requests to go out, and view the movement of people
